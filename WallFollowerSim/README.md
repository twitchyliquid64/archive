WallFollowerSim
===============

A simulation of a wall following algorithm. This was used to prototype a practical implementation on an arduino robot.

The algorithm was refined until it performed as desired. Then it was implemented in the real world. The algorithm performed almost identically
in the real world.



Warning - Prototype quality
