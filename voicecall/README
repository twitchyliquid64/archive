This repository was a prototype testing whether voicecalls can be
done entirely in the browser and entirely in javascript.

This was successful, and the system was rewritten for readability.
The rewritten system is https://github.com/twitchyliquid64/Micstream

This repository is for historical use only, and enforces no code
readibility or structure.
